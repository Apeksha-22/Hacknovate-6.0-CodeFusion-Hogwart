✨ Features That Bring Hogwarts to Life
🎩 1. The Sorting Hat & House-Themed UI
Your journey begins at Hogwarts!

🔮 The Sorting Hat will place you into Gryffindor, Slytherin, Ravenclaw, or Hufflepuff—either through a magical quiz or by random selection.

🏰 Your house determines your UI theme, wallpapers, animations, and even unique sound effects!

🦁 Gryffindor – Bold & adventurous theme

🐍 Slytherin – Mysterious & ambitious theme

🦅 Ravenclaw – Elegant & knowledge-driven theme

🦡 Hufflepuff – Warm & welcoming theme

🗺 2. The Marauder’s Map File Explorer
Ever wanted to navigate your files like a true Hogwarts student?

📜 Your file explorer unfolds like the Marauder’s Map, revealing hidden folders as you unlock XP!

💡 Say "I solemnly swear that I am up to no good" to reveal secret files. Mischief managed!

🧪 3. Potion Brewing App Installer
Installing apps shouldn’t be boring—it should be magical!

🫧 Drag and drop "ingredients" (files) into a bubbling cauldron to install new applications.

🔥 If you mix the wrong ingredients, you might brew a cursed app—so be careful!

🦉 4. Owl Post Notification System
Forget boring system alerts!

📜 Whenever you receive a notification, an owl flies across your screen, carrying a parchment with your message.

💡 Choose from Hedwig, Errol, or Pigwidgeon to be your personal owl!

🪄 5. Spell-Based Terminal Commands
Your terminal is now a spellbook!

Just type a spell, and magic happens:

Spell	Effect
lumos	Turns on light mode 🌞
nox	Turns on dark mode 🌙
accio [filename]	Summons a file 📂
expelliarmus <process>	Kills a process ❌
expecto patronum	Activates Patronus-themed lock screen ✨
apparate <path>	Instantly navigates to a directory 🌀
💡 Try whispering "Mischief Managed" to clear the terminal!

🎭 6. The Enchanted Portrait AI Assistant
Feeling lost? Let the Hogwarts Portrait AI guide you!

🖼 This AI-powered talking portrait acts like a real Hogwarts painting, helping you with system commands, troubleshooting, and even answering fun wizarding world questions.

💡 Ask "What’s the weather like in Hogsmeade?" and get real-time updates!

🔒 7. Patronus Lock Screen & Sleep Mode
Cast Expecto Patronum to lock your screen in true wizard fashion!

✨ A glowing Patronus (Deer, Wolf, Phoenix, etc.) appears, surrounded by mist and magical energy.

🔮 Unlocking your screen feels like swiping a wand!

🎖 8. House Points & Gamification
